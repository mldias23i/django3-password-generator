## Additional Instructions

To configure your Django project with a custom secret key, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your Django project.

3. Create a new file called `local_settings.py` in the same directory as your `settings.py` file.

4. Open the `local_settings.py` file in a text editor.

5. Generate a new `SECRET_KEY`. This can be done by using Python's built-in `secrets` module or by using online tools specifically designed for generating secure random strings.

   Here's an example using Python's `secrets` module:

   python
   # Import the secrets module
   import secrets

   # Generate a new secret key
   secret_key = secrets.token_hex(32)
   
   Alternatively, users can use online tools such as Django Secret Key Generator or Djecrety to generate a random SECRET_KEY.
   
6. Copy the generated SECRET_KEY.

7. In the local_settings.py file, define a variable called SECRET_KEY and assign the generated key to it.

    # local_settings.py

    # Define the SECRET_KEY variable
    SECRET_KEY = '<paste_the_generated_secret_key_here>'

8. Save the local_settings.py file.

9. In your settings.py file, import the SECRET_KEY from local_settings.

    # settings.py

    # Import the SECRET_KEY from local_settings
    from .local_settings import SECRET_KEY
    
10. Make sure to add local_settings.py to your project's .gitignore file. This ensures that the file is not shared publicly when pushing changes to a version control repository like Git.
